# DSDM Process Overview

The DSDM process provides a structured, end-to-end lifecycle for delivering solutions iteratively and incrementally.  
It combines agile product development with project management governance, covering the whole journey from initial idea through to benefits realisation.

## Key Concepts

- Iterative and incremental development  
- Early and continuous delivery of business value  
- Strong business involvement and ongoing feedback  
- Flexibility to tailor the lifecycle to project size and context  

---

## Full Process Model

DSDM defines six major phases. Each project tailors these to suit its scope, complexity, and delivery approach.

### 1. Pre-Project
Ensures the organisation is starting the *right* projects with clear objectives and sponsorship.  
Key outcomes:
- Confirm business need  
- Identify initial vision  
- Set up basic project structure  

---

### 2. Feasibility
A short, lightweight assessment to determine whether the project is viable and worth pursuing.  
Focus areas:
- Technical feasibility  
- Business feasibility  
- Rough outline of timescales, cost, and risk  

Small/simple projects may combine Feasibility and Foundations into a single step.

---

### 3. Foundations
Establishes a solid baseline for delivery without diving into detailed requirements.  
Covers:
- Business case and success criteria  
- High-level scope and solution architecture  
- Lifecycle configuration (e.g., number of iterations, deployment strategy)  
- Roles, responsibilities, and governance  

Provides enough clarity to start development while leaving room for discovery and evolution.

---

### 4. Evolutionary Development
The solution is built iteratively through frequent, timeboxed cycles.  
Activities include:
- Prioritisation using MoSCoW  
- Prototyping, modelling, and ongoing refinement  
- Regular business engagement and feedback  
- Continuous testing and assurance  

Each cycle evolves the solution until it meets the agreed acceptance criteria.

---

### 5. Deployment
Releases the solution (or increments of it) into operational use.  
Typical tasks:
- Assemble and finalise the release  
- Conduct user and business readiness activities  
- Deliver training, guidance, and business change  
- Implement the release and complete acceptance steps  

Deployment may occur once or multiple times, depending on the project strategy.

---

### 6. Post-Project
Assesses whether expected business benefits have been achieved after the solution is in use.  
Includes:
- Benefits realisation reviews  
- Measuring outcomes against the business case  
- Lessons learned for future initiatives  

---

## Lifecycle Tailoring

DSDM supports flexibility in how the phases are applied:
- Projects may have **multiple evolutionary cycles** and **multiple deployments**.  
- Foundations may be revisited to re-baseline scope or plan if business context changes.  
- Larger programmes may scale roles or add coordination layers while keeping the agile mindset.  

The goal is always the same: deliver business value early, frequently, and predictably.

---

## Why This Process Matters

- Aligns delivery with business goals from day one  
- Balances agility with project governance  
- Enables early delivery and fast feedback loops  
- Reduces risk through incremental development  
- Supports a wide range of project sizes and complexities
