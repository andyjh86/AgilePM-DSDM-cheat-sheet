## What is DSDM?

DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Method) is one of the earliest agile frameworks and forms the basis of AgilePM.  
It focuses on **business value**, **active user involvement**, and **predictable delivery through timeboxing**.  
DSDM is a **full project governance framework**, not just a delivery method — covering roles, products, lifecycle phases, and decision-making structures.

## Why Use DSDM?

DSDM is especially effective when working with vendors or suppliers, particularly on configuration-heavy projects. 
Its fixed-time, fixed-budget philosophy aligns naturally with commercial contracts, while its structured roles, documentation and governance provide clearer expectations and stronger control over deliverables.
This makes DSDM more practical than other methodologies, such as SCRUM, when delivering an agile project with strong governance across multiple parties.


## How DSDM differs from Scrum

While both are agile, they serve different purposes:

### **1. DSDM is a full project framework; Scrum is a delivery framework**
Scrum focuses on team workflow and iterative delivery.  
DSDM covers **project governance end-to-end**, including feasibility, foundations, business cases, roles, products and lifecycle phases.

### **2. Fixed-time, variable-scope model**
DSDM fixes time, cost and quality.  
Scope flexes using **MoSCoW prioritisation** to ensure delivery is still on time.  
Scrum does not enforce this model at the project level.

### **3. Defined products and documentation**
DSDM explicitly describes artefacts such as the Business Case, Foundations Summary, Solution Architecture Definition, etc.  
Scrum leaves documentation flexible and minimal.

### **4. Broader role structure**
DSDM assigns multiple business and technical roles to ensure alignment and governance.  
Scrum has only three: Product Owner, Scrum Master and Developers.

### **5. Lifecycle structure**
DSDM includes **Pre-Project → Feasibility → Foundations → Evolutionary Development → Deployment → Post-Project**.  
Scrum uses Sprints with no formal project-level phases.
