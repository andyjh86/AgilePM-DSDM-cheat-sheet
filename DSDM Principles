# Principles Overview

## Principle 1 - Focus on the Business Need

Every decision in a project should aim to deliver what the business needs, when it needs to be delivered. A project is a means to an end, not an end in itself.

To fulfil this principle, DSDM teams will:
- Understand true business priorities
- Establish a valid business case
- Ensure continuous business sponsorship and commitment
- Guarantee delivery of the Minimum Usable Subset (explained in MoSCoW prioritisation)

Specific business roles and practices in DSDM, such as timeboxing and MoSCoW prioritisation, enable teams to fulfil this principle.

## Principle 2 - Deliver on Time

Delivering a solution on time is often the most important success factor. Late delivery can undermine a project's rationale, especially with market opportunities or legal deadlines.

To fulfil this principle, DSDM teams need to:
- Timebox the work
- Focus on business priorities
- Always hit deadlines
- Build confidence through predictable delivery

Combining timeboxing and MoSCoW prioritisation enables teams to protect deadlines while flexing features and building a reputation for timely and predictable delivery.

## Principle 3 - Collaborate

Teams working in active cooperation and commitment outperform groups of individuals working in loose association. Collaboration increases understanding, speed, and shared ownership.

To fulfil this principle, DSDM teams need to:
- Involve the right stakeholders at the right time
- Encourage proactive involvement from business representatives
- Empower team members to make decisions
- Build a one-team culture

Roles such as Business Visionary, Business Ambassador, and Business Advisor bring subject matter experts into the project, fostering a collaborative environment.

## Principle 4 - Never Compromise Quality

The level of quality should be agreed upon at the start. The solution should be ‘good enough’ to meet agreed acceptance criteria.

To fulfil this principle, DSDM teams need to:
- Agree on the level of quality from the outset
- Ensure quality is not a variable
- Test early, continuously, and appropriately
- Build in quality by constant review
- Design and document appropriately

Testing is integrated into the Iterative Development process, with regular reviews to ensure quality standards are met.

## Principle 5 - Build Incrementally from Firm Foundations

Establish firm foundations before significant development. Understand the scope of the business problem and proposed solution without overly detailed analysis.

To fulfil this principle, DSDM teams need to:
- Conduct appropriate analysis and design up front (EDUF)
- Reassess priorities and project viability with each delivered Increment

This principle is implemented through a project lifecycle that delivers a solid base of knowledge before building the solution incrementally.

## Principle 6 - Develop Iteratively

Use Iterative Development, frequent demonstrations, and comprehensive review to encourage timely feedback. Embrace change as part of the evolutionary process.

To fulfil this principle, DSDM teams need to:
- Build business feedback into each iteration
- Recognize that detail should emerge later rather than sooner
- Embrace change
- Encourage creativity, experimentation, and learning

Iteration and constant review ensure the solution meets business needs, with feedback cycles for evolving project deliverables.

## Principle 7 - Communicate Continuously and Clearly

Poor communication is often the biggest cause of project failure. DSDM practices are designed to improve communication effectiveness.

To fulfil this principle, DSDM teams need to:
- Encourage informal, face-to-face communication
- Run daily team stand-ups
- Use workshops and facilitators where appropriate
- Use visual communication practices such as modeling and prototyping
- Demonstrate the evolving solution early and often
- Keep documentation lean and timely
- Manage stakeholder expectations with honesty and transparency

DSDM emphasizes human interaction through stand-ups, workshops, and active business involvement.

## Principle 8 - Demonstrate Control

It is essential to be in control of a project and demonstrate this. This is achieved by referencing a plan aligned with business objectives and ensuring transparency.

To fulfil this principle, DSDM teams, especially Project Managers and Team Leaders, need to:
- Make plans and progress visible
- Measure progress by product delivery, not activities
- Manage proactively
- Evaluate project viability based on business objectives
- Use appropriate formality for tracking and reporting

Well-defined timeboxes, constant reviews, and management plans help demonstrate and maintain control over the project.
