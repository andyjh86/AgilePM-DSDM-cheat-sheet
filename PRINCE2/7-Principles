## Define roles and responsibilities
Everyone involved must know what they are responsible for and what authority they hold. In practice, this avoids confusion, speeds up decisions, and ensures accountability throughout the project.
A simple tool such as a RACI matrix can help clarify who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed for each significant activity.

## Ensure continued business justification
A project should only continue if it still makes sense financially, strategically, and operationally. In practice, this means reassessing the business case at key points and stopping or adjusting the project if the justification no longer holds.

## Focus on products
Start with a clear understanding of what needs to be delivered before planning the work. In practice, this means defining the outputs, quality expectations and acceptance criteria early, so delivery stays aligned with real needs.

Remember:
**Management Products:** These are the project artefacts, documents and reports. Each should have a clear product description so anyone can understand its purpose and content, regardless of technical background.
**Specialist Products:** These are the actual deliverables the stakeholder will use, whether tangible or intangible. Their product descriptions must be written so a new person with little prior context can recognise what the product is and what it must achieve.

## Learn from experience
Projects should use lessons from previous work and capture new lessons as they go. In practice, this means reviewing lessons at the start of each stage and adjusting ways of working based on what has or hasn’t worked.

## Manage by exception
Set clear tolerances for time, cost, scope, risk, quality, and benefits. In practice, the team has freedom to deliver within those limits, and only escalates issues when they are likely to exceed agreed tolerances.

## Manage by stages
Break the project into manageable phases, each with its own plan, review, and approval to proceed. In practice, this provides natural checkpoints for assessing progress and confirming that the project is still viable.

## Tailor to suit the project
Adapt PRINCE2 to the project’s size, complexity, risk, and environment. In practice, this means keeping the method lightweight where possible and only applying controls and documentation that add genuine value.
