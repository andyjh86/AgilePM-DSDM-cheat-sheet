# PRINCE2 Minimum Artefacts (With Allowed Combinations)  
A concise reference for the **minimum PRINCE2 artefacts** required for a compliant project, including **which stage each artefact belongs to** and **which artefacts may be legally combined**.  
This document is optimised for practical delivery and aligned with PRINCE2 (2017) and PRINCE2 Agile guidance.

---

## Overview  
PRINCE2 has 26+ potential management products.  
A fully compliant project, however, requires only **eight artefacts**, many of which can be **combined**.

This document lists the **minimum artefacts only**, grouped by **PRINCE2 management stage**.

---

# 1. Starting Up a Project (SU)

## **Minimum Artefact**
### **Project Brief**

The **Project Brief** may combine:
- Outline Business Case  
- Project Product Description  
- Initial Project Approach  

This creates a single, lightweight foundation document for the Project Board to authorise initiation.

---

# 2. Initiating a Project (IP)

## **Minimum Artefact**
### **PID – Project Initiation Documentation**

The PID may legally combine all of the following into **one controlled document**:
- Business Case  
- Benefits Management Approach  
- Risk Management Approach  
- Quality Management Approach  
- Change Control Approach  
- Communication Management Approach  
- Project Plan  
- Project Controls (reporting cycles, tolerances, governance)  

This is the **largest consolidation point** in PRINCE2.

---

## **Additional Minimum Artefacts Created in IP**
These must remain distinct, but **may be stored in one combined workbook** (e.g., spreadsheet with multiple tabs):

### **Risk Register**  
### **Issue Register**  
### **Quality Register**  
### **Lessons Log**  

These cannot be merged into a single register, but may exist as separate sheets within a single file for convenience.

---

# 3. Controlling a Stage (CS)
_No new minimum artefacts are created in this stage._  
Only updates occur to:
- Risk Register  
- Issue Register  
- Quality Register  
- Lessons Log  

---

# 4. Managing Product Delivery (MP)
_No new minimum artefacts are created._  
Delivery teams update the existing registers as work progresses.

---

# 5. Managing a Stage Boundary (SB)

## **Minimum Artefact**
### **End Stage Report**

This artefact **cannot be combined** with others.  
It provides status and justification for continuing to the next stage.

---

# 6. Closing a Project (CP)

## **Minimum Artefacts**

### **End Project Report**
May incorporate:
- Follow-on actions  
- Benefits realisation updates  
- Quality summary  

### **Lessons Report**
This can be the **finalised Lessons Log**, meaning:
**Lessons Log + Lessons Report may be one artefact.**

# Ultra-Minimal PRINCE2 Artefact Set (Final List)

| # | Artefact | Stage | Combination Allowed? |
|---|----------|--------|----------------------|
| 1 | **Project Brief** | SU | Yes – combines Outline BC + PPD + Approach |
| 2 | **PID** | IP | Yes – combines ALL management approaches + BC + Plan + Controls |
| 3 | **Risk Register** | IP → all stages | No (but may be a sheet in a combined workbook) |
| 4 | **Issue Register** | IP → all stages | No (same as above) |
| 5 | **Quality Register** | IP → all stages | No (same as above) |
| 6 | **Lessons Log / Lessons Report** | IP → CP | Yes – Lessons Log becomes Lessons Report |
| 7 | **End Stage Report** | SB | No |
| 8 | **End Project Report** | CP | Yes – may include benefits + follow-on actions |

# Total Minimum Artefacts Required: **Eight**

1. Project Brief  
2. PID  
3. Risk Register  
4. Issue Register  
5. Quality Register  
6. Lessons Log / Lessons Report (combined)  
7. End Stage Report
